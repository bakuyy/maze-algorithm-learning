# Maze Algorithm Learning

- Playing around with [PyAmaze](https://github.com/MAN1986/pyamaze).  
- Learning BFS, DFS, A*, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms.  
- Generating random mazes and seeing how different algorithms solve them

### Algorithms I'm Trying:
- **BFS**: Finds the shortest path (unweighted).  
- **DFS**: Depth-first and more exploratory.  
- **A***: Combines cost + heuristic for smarter paths.  
- **Dijkstra**: Like BFS but accounts for weights (all weights here are 1).  

### Side Notes:
- Mazes are generated automatically.  
- Paths are traced based on the algorithm.
